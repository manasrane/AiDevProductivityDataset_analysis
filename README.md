# 🧠 AI Developer Productivity — Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores patterns and correlations in developer productivity when working with AI tools, using data sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to identify how variables such as coding hours, task complexity, and satisfaction influence overall productivity.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- Conducted in-depth **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers in AI-assisted developer workflows.
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw CSV files to handle missing values, outliers, and type inconsistencies.
- Created visualizations to interpret:
  - Distribution of work hours and task load
  - Developer satisfaction levels
  - Correlations between tool usage and productivity
- Generated insights to guide hypotheses about the effectiveness of AI tools in software development.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Developers reporting higher tool usage had marginally higher satisfaction and task throughput.
- Certain productivity metrics peaked within a specific work-hour range, hinting at optimal coding time blocks.
- Discovered non-linear relationships between task complexity and perceived productivity.
